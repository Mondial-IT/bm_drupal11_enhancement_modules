This document contains the meta development instructions to be executed by codex at the user direction.

## work process

- Documents with a format `codex.{title}.md` contain instructions to execute by codex.
- These instructions are to be executed complying to the documented general agent instructions in the `git_root\codex\agents\*.md` files.
- Repository location: `web/modules/custom/bm_aggrid`.
- On every feature change: update the relevant help topics, README, and wiki pages to keep admin-facing documentation in sync.

- Each feature contains a markdown checkbox `* [ ]` accompanied by a sequence number: example `* [ ] Feature 1.0`
- The user instructs (codex prompt) which feature (nr) to build next or to build 'all unchecked' features. Example: `execute open features from codex.step1.md` or `execute feature 1.0 from codex.step1.md`
- When the instruction is unclear (multiple solutions) do not execute the instruction and ask for clarification.

- When a feature has been created (ready):
  - you check annotate the document with the feature instruction:
  - you check the box (* [x] Feature ..) in this document
  - you add your notes below the feature lines prepended with: `codex:`
  - you analyse and update the `help_topics` and/or `README.md` documentation with relevant information.
